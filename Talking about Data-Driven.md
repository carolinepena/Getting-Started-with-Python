<h1>What Does It Mean to Be "Data-Driven"?</h1>

Being <b>Data-Driven</b> is about allowing data to guide decision-making processes. Data becomes a trusted advisor, providing insights that support better strategies in business, science, or daily life. It's about moving from "trial-and-error" to precision and foresight, where every decision is backed by evidence.

This mindset is essential in a world where uncertainty is high and competition is fierce. 

One example from daily life that helps to clarify this term is thinking about finding a route to an unfamiliar destination. Imagine you're trying to find your way to a destination in a city you don't know. Instead of relying on guesswork, you decide to use GPS navigation, which depends on real-time data about traffic, road closures and distances.
This is beign data-driven: using reliable and objective data to making decisions, rather than relying on intuition or assumptions.
